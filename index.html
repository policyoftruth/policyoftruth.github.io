                    Connection established. You've found your way to this corner
                    of the network. This is where I document my digital
                    wanderings, technical explorations, and occasional
                    philosophical musings about code, security, and the spaces
                    between.

                    This blog is intentionally minimal—a single file, no
                    frameworks, no build steps. Just raw HTML, CSS, and
                    thoughts. Edit the source, push to git, and it's live.
                    Simple. Direct. As it should be.

                    There's something liberating about stripping away the
                    unnecessary. Modern web development has become
                    bloated—megabytes of JavaScript just to display text. We've
                    forgotten that simplicity is a feature, not a limitation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A static HTML file loads instantly. No webpack, no
                    node_modules directory that could collapse into a black
                    hole. Just open your editor, write, save, deploy. The
                    barrier between thought and publication collapses to zero.

$ echo "hello world" &gt; index.html
$ git push
# shipped.
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    This is how it should be. Fast. Efficient. Under your
                    control.

                    discoveries, experiments, and ideas worth preserving. No
                    algorithms deciding what you see. No tracking. No analytics.
                    Just signal.
