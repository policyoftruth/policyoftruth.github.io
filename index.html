            <p>
                Head on a pike, plain and vacant tonight<br>
                As you cry through your phone, let the masses support<br>
                All the hate that you spit, keep a mouth full of shit<br>
                See your smile out at town and our shirt that you sport, woe is me<br>
                Eavesdrop in class, keep your ear to the glass, woe's me
            </p>
            <p>
                It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance<br>
                Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers<br>
                You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby<br>
                Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me
            </p>
            <p>
                Prisoner compliance, you'll tend to your bias<br>
                Be sure you're identical to all your peers<br>
                Keep your head low, suggestive, horror show like clockwork<br>
                Predictable, simple, then turn of a gear
            </p>
            <p>
                It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance<br>
                Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers<br>
                You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby<br>
                Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me
            </p>
            <p>
                It's getting harder not to lose myself when you clearly wanted someone else<br>
                Staying awake 'cause I never feel safe at home<br>
                Double-check the locks and hide my phone, try to drink away peripheral ghosts<br>
                Turn out the lights, it's my fault I'm never alone
            </p>
