        <div class="lyrics">Head on a pike, plain and vacant tonight
            As you cry through your phone, let the masses support
            All the hate that you spit, keep a mouth full of shit
            See your smile out at town and our shirt that you sport, woe is me
            Eavesdrop in class, keep your ear to the glass, woe's me

            It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance
            Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers
            You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby
            Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me

            Prisoner compliance, you'll tend to your bias
            Be sure you're identical to all your peers
            Keep your head low, suggestive, horror show like clockwork
            Predictable, simple, then turn of a gear

            It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance
            Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers
            You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby
            Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me

            It's getting harder not to lose myself when you clearly wanted someone else
            Staying awake 'cause I never feel safe at home
            Double-check the locks and hide my phone, try to drink away peripheral ghosts
            Turn out the lights, it's my fault I'm never alone</div>
