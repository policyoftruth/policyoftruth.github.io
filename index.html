    <p>
        Head on a pike, plain and vacant tonight
        As you cry through your phone, let the masses support
        All the hate that you spit, keep a mouth full of shit
        See your smile out at town and our shirt that you sport, woe is me
        Eavesdrop in class, keep your ear to the glass, woe's me

        It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance
        Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers
        You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby
        Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me

        Prisoner compliance, you'll tend to your bias
        Be sure you're identical to all your peers
        Keep your head low, suggestive, horror show like clockwork
        Predictable, simple, then turn of a gear

        It's good to hate, isn't it? Popping veins, dissonance
        Draw and quarter a stranger to feel some blood on your fingers
        You take away, robbery, follow trends as a hobby
        Find flaws in everything else because you don't like yourself, woe is me

        It's getting harder not to lose myself when you clearly wanted someone else
        Staying awake 'cause I never feel safe at home
        Double-check the locks and hide my phone, try to drink away peripheral ghosts
        Turn out the lights, it's my fault I'm never alone
