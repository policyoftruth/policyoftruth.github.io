                       I picked up this game today and find that I am really enjoying it. It's nice to finally have a
                       game that is decently optimized and is actually fun. I hope the gaming industry can follow this as
                       a trend where they start to prioritize fun over ensuring an unnecessary "next-gen" experience.

                        living in the night | Left to blind destruction |

                        alone | Staying in the same place, just staying out the

                        Embrace the change. Don't abuse it. My use of AI
                        recently has helped solidify my thoughts on the matter.
                        As nearly anything in meat-space, AI can and will be
                        abused but as long as you temper reliance, stay curious,
                        and keep learning -- I say jack-in.

                        There's something liberating about stripping away the
                        unnecessary. Modern web development has become bloated
                        bits of unnecessary frameworks that assault your senses.
                        We've forgotten that simplicity is a feature, not a
                        limitation.

                    <p>
                        A static HTML site loads instantly. No unpacking and no
                        node_modules directory that could collapse into a black
                        hole. You just open your editor, write, save, and
                        deploy. The barrier between thought and publication now
                        collapses to zero.
